Where's my tea?
===============

Three simple words. A very common question. Everyone knows what this means.

It's in the cupboard
--------------------

The word tea here is not a reference to the leaves in the bags in the jar in the
cupoard.

My tea is yet to be made.

You drank it
------------

So you've never had tea before? That's a lie. I saw you make a cup yesterday.
What you mean is, there is a culturally acceptable timeframe for tea to be
absent, which the current context does not satisfy.

It's time to make my tea.

Do it yourself
--------------

Or maybe you were trying to make a point. If you'd wanted tea, you should
have gone and done it.

Did I make the tea yesterday? If I did, then you are getting too used to me
being your servant. Or else, I'm the lazy one.
