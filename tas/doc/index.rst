Where's my tea?
===============

Three simple words. A very common question. Everyone knows what this means.

It's in the cupboard
--------------------

The word tea here is not a reference to the leaves in the bags in the jar in the
cupoard.

My tea is yet to be made. The drink is part of the making.

You drank it
------------

So you've never had tea before? That's a lie. I saw you make a cup yesterday.
What you mean is, there is a culturally acceptable timeframe for teamaking
to be unperformed, which the current context does not satisfy.

It's time to make my tea.

Do it yourself
--------------

Or maybe you were trying to make a point. If you'd wanted tea, you should
have gone and done it.

Did I make the tea yesterday? If I did, then you are getting too used to me
being your servant. Or else, I'm the lazy one.

Use Case
========

In order to make tea, at a minimum there must be access to the following items:
* A kettle with hot water in it.
* A clean mug with a teabag. One for each Consumer.

Once these conditions are met, perform *brewing* by pouring the hot water into
each mug. At this point a spoon is required.

The teabag must be removed prior to *serving*.

According to the preference of each Consumer, these optional items may be added
to the corresponding mug at any time after the teabag is removed:
* Milk

According to the preference of each Consumer, these optional items may be added
to the corresponding mug at any time:
* Sugar

No water in the kettle?
    Perform *filling*.

Water in the kettle is not hot?
    Perform *boiling*.

Not enough clean mugs?
    Perform *washing*.

Principal Actor
    The Producer who makes the tea.
    The expectation of the Producer is *serving* the tea.

Secondary Actors
    The Consumer for whom tea is made.
    The expectation of the Consumer is *drinking* the tea.

Elaborations

    * The Producer may or may not be a Consumer of the tea.
    * The Producer may relinquish control to another.
    * Consumers may assist if asked, eg: Can you get the mugs out for me?
