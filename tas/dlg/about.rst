This is a technical demo and teaching example for the `turberfield-catchphrase`_ package.
A modern, web-native Python library you can download and install today. It's there_ for you to use.

Catchphrase is unique in the way it lets you layer beautifully-written dialogue on top of well-tested game logic.
Your Interactive Story will be a work of art, and at the same time a nice piece of engineering.

*   Catchphrase is 100% Free software.
*   Your game logic is Python code.
*   Character dialogue lives in separate screenplay files.
*   Catchphrase renders your story in pure HTML5 and CSS3. No Javascript is necessary.
*   Web serve over the network or play by text in a terminal.

Why not `see how it's done`_?
