This is a technical demo and teaching example for the `turberfield-catchphrase`_ package.
A modern, web-native Python library, it's there_ for you to use. You can download and install it today.

Catchphrase is unique in the way it lets you layer beautifully-written dialogue on top of well-tested game logic.
Your Interactive Story will be a work of art, and at the same time a piece of great engineering.

*   Catchphrase is 100% Free software.
*   You write your game logic as Python code.
*   You notify the Catchphrase parser of your command syntax.
*   You craft character dialogue via simple screenplay files.
*   Catchphrase renders your story in pure HTML5 and CSS3. No Javascript is necessary.
*   You can host on the network or play it locally in a terminal.
    Exactly the same code, without any modification.
